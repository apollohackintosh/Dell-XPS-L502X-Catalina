Dell XPS L502X build.

I have this laptop lying around and wanted to bring it up to speed and hackintosh it. The official supported OS is Snow Leopard
but it is possible to have Catalina run on it and with a few tweaks, make it very usable.

Details of the laptop:

CPU Type: Mobile DualCore Intel Core i5-2430M, 2766 MHz (28 x 99)
Motherboard Name: Dell System XPS L502X
Motherboard Chipset: Intel Cougar Point HM67, Intel Sandy Bridge
System Memory: 16GB DDR3 SDRAM
BIOD Type: Phoenix (07/20/2011)
Graphics: GeForce GT 525M, Intel HD Graphics 3000

The guide to set up the USB is as follows for Sandy Bridge devices:

Please follow it explicitly and download the Catalina recovery image instead of the Snow Leopard image.
